Economical Feasibility:

Costs:

1) Development Cost = 12000 Tk


2) Fixed Cost = Development Cost = 12000 Tk


Variable Cost = Maintainance Cost = 5000 Tk


Operational Cost = 60000 Tk (1 year)

Suppose,

	Server-cost = 1000 Tk
	
Maintainance-Team-Cost = 2000 Tk
	
Benefit = Reciveced Operational Cost - Actual Operational Cost
	= 5000 - (1000 + 2000 )
	= 2000 Tk
	
It depends on which situation occured. That vaires that the project is gained benefit or loss
